- I graduated with a degree in Computer Sciences and Engineering from SabancÄ± University. (july, 2022)

Also, i was a member of R&D Deep Learning project team.
- I am currently working at BatPad Studio as a Game Developer since Jan,2022 using Unity (C#) and getting familiar with Django back-end as a side project.
- I am interested in Mobile Development, Web Development, Game Development. I am familiar with Flutter and Angular for cross platform apps.
- As i said, I am interested in Web Development but web development is in the back-burner.
- The languages that I am most comfortable with are (in order of most to least) C++, C#, python, TypeScript, Dart, JavaScript.
- Although I don't have much knowledge on these fields I am also interested in Blockchain, Automative Testing, Programming language development, OS development and other low level stuff. I hope to get more knowledge in these fields as time goes on.

Other than coding I am interested in computer games, gym, sports, science and travelling.
